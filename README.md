A CLI tool designed to process Rust source code, creating a high-level context
suitable for Large Language Models (LLMs). It eliminates non-essential
information that allows you share with LLMs large codebases.

## Overview

When working with LLMs on large codebases, it's crucial to balance providing
enough context while staying within context window limits and optimizing for
cost and performance. This tool processes Rust code to remove unnecessary
implementation details while preserving the essential structure and interfaces.

### Considerations

- **Context Window Management**: By stripping down the code to its essential
  structure, the tool helps fit more relevant information within the LLM's
  context window, which is crucial for effective processing and understanding.
- **Focus on Essentials**: The tool preserves the module structure, type
  definitions, function signatures, and important comments, which are often
  sufficient for understanding the overall architecture and design of the
  project.
- **Reduced Noise**: Removing implementation details and test code reduces
  noise, allowing the LLM to focus on the high-level structure and relationships
  within the codebase.
- **Scalability**: This approach scales well with large projects, as it avoids
  overwhelming the LLM with unnecessary details, making it easier to handle and
  process large codebases.
- **Incremental Sharing**: The tool's approach of sharing small parts of the
  codebase as needed ensures that the LLM has access to detailed information
  when required, without overwhelming it with the entire codebase.

## Features

- **Removes**:
  - Function bodies (with specific exceptions)
  - Test functions (`#[test]`) and test modules (`#[cfg(test)]`)
  - Doc comments and module-level documentation when the `--no-comments` flag is
    used
  - Implementation details of derived traits
- **Preserves**:
  - Module structure and imports
  - Type definitions (structs, enums, traits)
  - Function signatures and interfaces
  - Non-test attributes (e.g., `#[derive]`)
  - Doc comments and module-level documentation (unless `--no-comments` is
    specified)
  - Function bodies for:
    - String-like return types (`String`, `&str`, `Cow<str>`)
    - `Result<T, E>` where `T` is string-like
    - `Option<T>` where `T` is string-like
    - Custom `Serialize` trait implementations
  - Special trait method annotations:
    - `/// This is a required method` for required trait methods
    - `/// There is a default implementation` for methods with default
      implementations
  - File paths relative to the `src` directory with `main.rs` and `lib.rs` files
    if the `--single-file` flag is used

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-context.git
cd code-context

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
code-context <input_path>

# With options
code-context <input_path> --output-dir <suffix_for_output_dir_name> --no-comments --stats --dry-run --single-file
```

### Command Line Options

```
Options:
  -o, --output-dir <NAME>  Output directory name [default: code-context]
      --no-comments        Remove all comments (including doc comments)
      --stats              Show processing statistics
      --dry-run            Run without writing output files
      --single-file        Output all files into a single combined file
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version
```

## Examples

Generated output files can be found in the
[`src-code-context`](./src-code-context/) and
[`src-custom-suffix`](./src-custom-suffix/) directories.

- The file
  [`src-code-context/code_context.rs.txt`](./src-code-context/code_context.rs.txt)
  was generated by passing the path to the `src` directory of this repo with the
  `--single-file` flag.
- Files in the [`src-custom-suffix`](./src-custom-suffix/) directory were
  generated by passing the path to the `src` directory with the
  `--output-dir custom-suffix` flag.

In both cases, the size reduction is 85.8% (from 37416 bytes to 5330 bytes).

### Before and After Example

**Before:**

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

**After:**

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {}
```

## FAQ

**Q: What types of files does this tool process?**\
A: The tool processes files with the `.rs` extension only. It does not process
files with `.toml`, `.json`, or other extensions.

**Q: Can I run the tool without writing output files?**\
A: Yes, use the `--dry-run` flag to run the tool without writing output files.

**Q: Why output file(s) have an extension `.rs.txt`. Why not generate `.rs`
file(s)?**\
A: If the tool generates `.rs` files, the `rust-analyzer` will generate a lot of
compilation errors. To avoid this, the tool generates `.rs.txt` files.
